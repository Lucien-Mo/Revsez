It's very important and i need you to read this text. All those tools that i made are for *educational purposes only* i do not encourage nobody
to use this with a bad intention. _ would not be included, in trouble if you don't listen this.Also, there's a license so you can't steal my code.
I let you change the code and after i would create a discord server to share all yours new scripts.
